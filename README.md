# De Windhond
Milestone 1 project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a webpage is made by Johan de Leeuw. It's for an iconic building in my hometown. Their own website doesn't look so good. So I wanted to see if I could give it an upgrade.

## Demo
You an find a preview of the website [here](https://jdl208.github.io/DeWindhond/).

## UX
I wanted to make a one page website which contains all the necessary information in an easy reachable manner.
## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

# Testing
I tested the website in multiple browsers. The smooth scrolling effect doesn't work on every browser, but I didn't want to use other javascript in this project besides the ones from bootstrap and font awesome, because that is outside the scope of this project.

The images in the header are not all in a good resolution. But ididn't want to use images that weren't really connected to De Windhond. When the site would go live. I would get better images.
## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.
## Credits
### Content
Content is derived from the [site][1] of the mill and translated by myself.
### Media
All the images and the video where taken from the [website][1] of the mill and from their [facebook page][2].
