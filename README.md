<h1>De Windhond</h1>
Milestone 1 project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a webpage for an iconic building in my hometown. Their own website doesn't look so good. So I wanted to see if I could give it an upgrade.

<h2>Demo</h2>
You an find a preview of the website <a href="https://jdl208.github.io/DeWindhond/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>UX</h2>
I wanted to make a one page website which contains all the necessary information in an easy reachable manner.
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ol>
<h2>Testing</h2>
I tested the website in multiple browsers. The smooth scrolling effect doesn't work on every browser, but I didn't want to use other javascript in this project besides the ones from bootstrap and font awesome, because that is outside the scope of this project.
<h2>Deployment</h2>
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.
